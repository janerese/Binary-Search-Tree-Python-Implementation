# Binary-Search-Tree-Python-Implementation

Credits to https://www.youtube.com/@codebasics for these two video tutorials: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFq5mYUWEBk (Binary Tree Part 1 | BST | Binary Search Tree - Data Structures & Algorithms Tutorials In Python #10) & 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnrbMQyGLiU&t=3s (Binary Tree Part 2 | BST | Binary Search Tree - Data Structures & Algorithms Tutorials In Python #11)

I followed the two videos by codebasics on YouTube and finished the coding part and exercises for the Binary Search Tree data structure using Python Implementation.
I also tested out the Binary Search Tree data structure using the letters of my fullname as the content of the binary tree.
